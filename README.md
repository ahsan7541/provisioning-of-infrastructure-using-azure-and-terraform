# Provisioning-of-infrastructure-using-azure-and-terraform
**1- Install Terraform:** Begin by installing Terraform on your local machine or the environment where you plan to execute your Terraform scripts. You can download Terraform from the official website (https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and follow the installation instructions provided.

**2- Create an Azure Account:** If you haven't already, create an Azure account at https://azure.microsoft.com/. You will need an active Azure subscription to provision resources.

**3- Set Up Azure Credentials:** To authenticate with Azure, you'll need to set up your Azure credentials. Terraform supports several authentication methods, including service principals, managed identities, and Azure CLI. The most common method is using a service principal, which requires creating an Azure Active Directory (AD) application and assigning appropriate roles and permissions to it.

a- Register an Azure AD application: In the Azure portal, go to Azure Active Directory > App Registrations and create a new application registration.  
b- Obtain the client ID and client secret: Once the application is created, retrieve the client ID and client secret (or certificate) for authentication.  
c- Assign permissions and roles: Assign the required permissions and roles to the service principal based on the resources you want to provision.  
d- Create a Terraform Configuration: In your local development environment, create a new directory to hold your Terraform configuration files. Create a new file with a .tf extension (e.g., main.tf) and define your infrastructure resources using the Terraform syntax. For example, you can create virtual networks, virtual machines, storage accounts, etc., and define their configurations, such as size, location, and other properties.

**4- Initialize Terraform:** Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where your Terraform configuration file is located. Run the command terraform init to initialize the Terraform working directory. This command downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend configuration.

**5- Configure Azure Provider:** Within your Terraform configuration file, configure the Azure provider to authenticate with Azure using the previously obtained credentials. Provide the subscription ID, client ID, client secret, and tenant ID as part of the provider configuration.

**6- Plan and Apply:** Run the command terraform plan to create an execution plan. Terraform will analyze your configuration files, determine the changes needed to achieve the desired state, and provide a summary of the planned actions. Review the plan and ensure it aligns with your expectations.
If everything looks good, you can apply the changes by running terraform apply. Terraform will create the specified resources in Azure based on your configuration.
``` bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform validate
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

**7- Manage Infrastructure:** After the infrastructure is provisioned, you can use Terraform to manage it over time. If you need to make any changes to your infrastructure, modify the Terraform configuration files, and run terraform plan and terraform apply again. Terraform will automatically update or create resources as necessary to match the desired state.

**8- Destroy Infrastructure:** If you want to tear down the provisioned infrastructure, you can use terraform destroy. This command will remove all the resources created by Terraform, but be cautious as it's a destructive action. Take care to ensure you're targeting the correct environment before executing the destroy command.

These steps provide a general overview of provisioning infrastructure using Terraform and Azure. It's essential to consult the Terraform documentation and Azure documentation for more detailed instructions and examples based on your specific requirements. https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs
